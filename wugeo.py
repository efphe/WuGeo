  `coords` is a list of tuples:

     [(lat, long, count),... ]

  where `lat` is latitude, `long` is longitude and `count` is
  the number of visitors coming from this location.

  `sfile` is the geographic source map file.
  `dfile` is the destination file.

  `factor` is a scaling parameter. Tune with it your points dimensions.

  You can set your favorite colors with `col` and `bcol`.
  
  `base` and `steps` control the points growing. For example, if base is 10
  and steps is 5, point changes their dimensions when `count` becomes 
  1,10,100,1000,10000.
  
  `minpoint` is the dimension of one point when count is less then `base`^2 - 1"""
