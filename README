Hello,

WuGeo is a python module to design world geographical map.
It's trivially inspired by clustrmaps:

  http://clustrmaps.com

and used in production environment on the WuBook suite:

  http://en.wubook.net/, http://wubook.net/

I coded it because clustrmaps (and alternatives) does not offer a
valid SSL certificate: including their maps on a protected site 
is problematic.

Anyway, now WuGeo is coded, we have a flexible system to create
our custom maps!

WuGeo uses the Miller map projection (aka cylindrical projection). 
You need a compatible world map. 

Install WuGeo as usual:

  # python setup.py install

or use it directly, without system installation.

WuGeo interface is composed by a unique function:

  >>> print wugeo.geo_marker.__doc__

Enjoy!
